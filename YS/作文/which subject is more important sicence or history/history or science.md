**Some people say History is one of the most important school subjects. Other people think that, in today's world, subjects like science and technology are more important that history. **

**Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.**

People have different views of such an issue, which is about the importance of two converse subjects. Some people support that history is more important than others known as science and technology, but others do not. I believe that subjects like science and technology are more important.

On the one hand, history undertakes an important role in the development of human society. Firstly, history can bring us back to the ancient period and give us a vivid imagination of how our ancestors lived. Secondly, we can acquire abundant experience and knowledge from history, which are still useful in our daily lives. For instance, the structure of some of our buildings still refers to lots of old buildings, which can save money and energy. Finally, the national heroes who wrote down in history provide us excellent examples to follow and tight our relationship with our country.

 On the other hand, it is perhaps science and technology are more important instead of history. Apparently, science and technology occupy almost every aspect of our lives. For example, the invention of the Internet brings the imagination of contact with each other where we want into real lives. It is hard to imagine what will happen if science and technology suddenly disappear. Science and technology can not only provide convenience for us, but also benefit our future generations. Furthermore, developing science and technology can lead us to more secrets of the universe and even the source of humans and other creatures.

 In summary, although history provides us abundant knowledge, science and technology should acquire a more important rate in school teaching.
