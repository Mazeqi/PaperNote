**Some people think that universities should provide graduates with the knowledge and skills needed in the workplace. Others think that the true function of a university should be to give access to knowledge for its own sake, regardless of whether the course is useful to an employer.**

**What, in you opinion, should be the main function of a university.**



Amounts of people agree with the idea which supports universities to teach students with workplace skills or knowledge, while others argue that colleges should make students accessible to knowledge without any concrete purposes. In my opinion, I agree that universities should provide useful workplace skills.

 

There are various factors we should consider why students should not study without their final purposes. Firstly, nowadays, it is convenient for almost all the students to accumulate knowledge from the Internet. And because of the abundant resources, we often can not find out what we should learn. For example, I don't know what to gain when facing so many subjects. Secondly, learning knowledge without any focus will lead to such an aspect that a student touches everything but does not have any strength that exceeds other students. Finally, most students want to find a job when graduating from college, while no concentration learning is not suitable for that.

 

 To concentrate on the skills or knowledge that are useful and necessary for our future work is fulfilled with the requirement of society. In such a way, students can realize what to learn from piles of knowledge. The student who has a major core to learn will be motivated and he or she will acquire more possibility to succeed in his subject. For example, Pony Ma, who is the leader of Tencent, focused on the subject of computer science that prepared for his work and now he is a famous person in front of us. In order to be proficient for future interviews and exceed others in the eyes of employers, it is really necessary to teach students the working skills in the courses.

 

 In conclusion, there are lots of advantages I support teaching students with useful knowledge for their future work. I really enjoy such teaching mode.
