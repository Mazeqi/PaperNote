The charts presented here reflect the average proportions of three types of nutrients in typical meals, including sodium, saturated fats and added sugar, all of which are significant to us but will lead to being unhealthy if we eat too much. All the data was collected in the USA.

 

 	Apparently, the sodium is got mostly at dinner, at 43%, followed by the second consumption at lunch, at 29%. And the remaining is divided into equal percentage for snacks and breakfast, at 14% respectively. Compared to sodium, it is similar that the most consumption of saturated fats is also in dinner, at 37%, and lunch also follows the dinner, at 26%. And the rest are gained in snacks and breakfast, at 21% and 16% respectively. Differently, however, the added sugar is gained mostly in snacks, at 42%, with dinner at the second position of 23%. And lunch and breakfast are at third and fourth with 19% and 16% respectively.

 

 	All in all, the diagrams show that every typical meal consumed in the USA contains a percentage of at least 14% of nutrients that can be unhealthy if eaten too much.
