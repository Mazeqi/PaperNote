# Animals

- Animals are sentient
- Animals know no evil
- Animals and humans should be treated equals
- Animals are more intelligent than humans
- humans are naturally superior to animals



1. I agree with it. Because in our daily life, there are many people live with dogs. And the dog I think really intelligent is the guide dogs used to help blind person. They can finish a lot of things that the blind people can't do, such as guiding blind people to by bus, delivering  things blind people in need, and the guide dog are really patient to blind people, and in my eyes, they give the blind people love.
2. I think so. Because the defination of evil or no evil is made by humans but no animals. I think in animals lives, they all follow the natural rules to live, such as some animals may eat vegetable and the other may eat meat. 
3. I don't think so. But we should protect wild animals. On the one hand, the humans are the most intelligent species in the world, and humans find out many secrets of the world and invent a lot of high tech things.  On the other hand, the wild animals are really important in the world, without them, the balance of world will be break out. So I think animals and the humans are not equal, but we should protect the animals.
4. The humans are the most intelligent species in the world, and humans find out many secrets of the world and invent a lot of high tech things. The humans can find out the secrets on birds and then invent the plane, but the animals can not.
5. No, I do not think so. Because the natural world need balance between the humans and the animals. Without animals, the species variety will be destroyed, which will influence the Food crops of people.
