# Athlete

- What athletes and celebrities do is worth the money they get
- Athletes and celebrities are not good role models
- The success of athletes is just a matter of supply and demand
- Celebrities should earn less because their jobs don't save lives
- Athletes and celebrities influence the progress of society.



1. I think athletes and famous stars are paid too much money. They earn much more than people who provide vital services to others. For example, doctors and nurses contribute more to society but earn much less than athletes and sports stars
2. I don't think so. In my opinion, to be good role model or not to be good role model is according to personal selection.  However, I think athletes and celebrities should be good role models. Because many Children admire them and copy what they do. For instance, they should show respect to other peoples and avoid using bad language. They should contribute to charity. And they should encourage children to develop healthy lifestyle.
3. Yes, Their very high incomes are the result of their popularity among sports fans. For example, in my country, the sports industry is huge and there are millions of sports fans who are willing pay to see their favourite sports stars play in person
4. Yes, Because I think we should pay more attention to the people make more effort to contribute to the society, such doctors、policemen、nurse and so on, they should be paid more.
5. I don't think so. Because I think the ordinary people that work hard in their position make progress to the society. To improve the society needs everyone's Mood and sweat. When we are sleeping in our home, there may be lots of people protecting us in their position, such as policeman、military
