Last week, I went to a quiz night with some of my friends. It was an event that was being hosted by a club at our university, and was supposed to raise funds for an end of year party. Eager to help out, we went along.

The quiz night was held at a venue on campus. There were circular table all around the room and a quiz master who asked questions and scored points up on a stage.

At the beginning of the night the quiz master told us that the main rule of the game was that mobile phones were not allowed to be used. This was because the organizers wanted to ensure that nobody cheated.

While I often feel a bit lost without my mobile phone, I definitely understood the rationale behind this rule. The game wouldn't be fun unless it was fair, so it was essential that no teams got an advantage over the others. And in the end, I didn't even miss having my phone available to me. Instead, I was able to enjoy the company of my friends without the distraction of constant phone notifications.
