The street market in my city is called the Farmer's market. I think it was two weeks ago when I went there.

The market was held on the playground of one of  the schools here because the school was not in session. Farmers and other vendors would have booths in which they could sell food items they grow or bake. At the market, my mother and I bought some fresh onions, green beans, cobs of corn, and tomatoes. We also purchased a dozen hand-made dumplings and some rice noodles as well as some freshly cooked ribs.

We all enjoyed the market experience as we knew that all the foods there were fresh, not to mention it as really close to where we lived. In the near future, my mother and I would like to visit that place a couple of times a month. We liked the feeling that we would be able to support the local farmers and vendors by buying their goods. That would help them and it also would help support the local economy.
