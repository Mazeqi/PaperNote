I recently read an article from a science magazine about exercise. The article said that a minimum of 30 minutes of exercise a day was a common misconception among most people. It said that the majority of university students take this piece of advice too lightly, and simply think of 'exercising' as walking from place to place. However, in order to have a healthy life, it is important to exercise at a high pace. This means that we could have to at least break a sweat and increase our heart rate to get a proper form of exercise.

I read the article in the biology classroom for an assignment for the Sports and Health module, since I have a test coming up next week.

Reading this article got me thinking about my own exercise habits, and I decided it may be a good idea to join a gym or sports team. I think one step at a time, engaging with sports at more increased level will not only improve my health, but will help me feel better about myself. How great it would be if I became a swimming or football professional by the end of the year! If I work hard now, I'm sure I'll reap the rewards later in the year.
