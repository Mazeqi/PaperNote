One time, I was asked to share my food. It was a meal my mum had packed in a lunchbox consisting of sandwiches, fried chicken wings, and a few chocolate bars. Since I had a fieldtrip to the zoo that day with my classmates, I brought some food along because I knew I would get hungry. Around noon time, we had finally finished walking around the entire zoo. It was time for lunch, and I ended up sharing my meal with my best friend. In her excitement, she had forgotten to bring food with her to zoo.

Even though I was famished, I knew my best friend was starving too. She looked at me as I took my first bite with longing sad eyes. Because she was someone I genuinely cared about, I decided to hand her a sandwich, a fired chicken wing and one chocolate bar. It was not enough to fill her up, but her stomach was no longer grumbling.

Despite not being able to enjoy the meal all by myself, I surprisingly felt very happy and fulfilled. I knew that I had done a good deed and helped someone out. A little kindness goes a long way.
