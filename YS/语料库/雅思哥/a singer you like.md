​	Katy Perry is my favorite singer. Not only do I enjoy the beat and rhythm of her songs, I also enjoy the lyrics.

​	She's always positive and her positive personality is reflected in the lyrics of her songs, which relate well to young people and the problems and situations that young people often experience.

​	Perry's songs incorporate a lot of different styles of music, including pop, rock, disco and some gospel. I like the fact that her music seems to be constantly evolving. Each album seems to be significantly different from the previous albums. 

​	Although Perry is sometimes too flamboyant for my liking, with her different hairstyles and wardrobe, I still a big fan of her song. The lyrics of her songs are honest and truthful, vulnerable and relatable. Her songs speak to relationships, self-reflection, and everyday life. She preaches self-empowerment and liberation. 

​	One of my favorite Katy Perry songs, titled Firework, is extremely upbeat, telling people "you don't have to feel like a 'waste of space' because "you're original" and “can not be replaced” . I appreciate the positive messages in many of Katy Perry songs.
