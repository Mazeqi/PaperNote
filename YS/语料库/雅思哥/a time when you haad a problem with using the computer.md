It was early December last year when I had an issue with my laptop. It didn't exactly crash, but there was a serious problem. I was going to begin my homework at home, so I pressed the power button of my computer to start it up, but nothing happened. So I tried again, but there was still no response. I then plugged in the charger, but the power light kept blinking, which was quite unusual. I decided to charge my computer a bit and tried to restart it around 15 minutes later. Finally. it worked. The problem, however, was that it happened in the same way the following day.

My brother suggested that I have it checked at the computer shop because it was still under warranty. So I took it to the shop, and the technician examined it. It also didn't turn on, so he told me he'd send it to the main office to have the keyboard replaced. So I filled out a form, left the laptop with him, and went home to wait. Thankfully, my laptop was returned after a week. They changed the keyboard since something was wrong with the power button on it.
