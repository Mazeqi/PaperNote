​	Someone polite that I know is Mr Chan, my English teacher in my last year in high school,

​	He was new to my school that year and we heard that he had studied English aboard. He was a very good teacher as he was funny and always smiling. He was also very patient and polite when he corrected our mistakes. I felt he was quite different,  as I had gotten used to teachers that would raise their voices every time the class made mistakes. 

​	Mr Chan was not like that. He actually shared his reason in one of his lectures, and it had an impact on me. He said that learning a language was a lot like learning the arts, such as singing or dancing. If someone is new to singing or dancing and they are laughed at or insulted as they attempt to perform, chances are they won't do it again, even if the talent is within.

​	So he does his best not to insult anyone that is trying to learn English as they might give up because of embarrassment. I thought that was an important lesson indeed because a lot of second language learners really struggle early on.
