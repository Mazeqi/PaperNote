A week ago, I watched something very interesting. I was waiting for my mother at the shopping mall and was feeling very bored, so I took out my mobile phone and began scrolling through my social media apps.

As I was looking through an app called Douyin, I chanced  upon this video. Douyin is a video-sharing social platform where people post a variety of short clips which are usually less than a minute long. These clips come from a wide range of genres like comedy and dance.

In this short clip a user posted a video of her do. She inserted many scenes in the video. These scenes showed the entire process of her preparing a gourmet meal for her dog. These meal included quail eggs, minced meat, steamed salmon, vitamin supplements, and a little brown rice. The foods were arranged nicely on a blue ceramic plate.

I found this video very interesting because I had never seen anyone prepare such luxurious and extravagant food for a dog. I usually imagined that a dog would be able to live off dry dog food. Apparently, the video said that these foods provide essential nutrients for a dog to lead a long and healthy life. This surprised me greatly.
