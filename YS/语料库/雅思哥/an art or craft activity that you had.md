I made a watercolor painting. Watercolor paintings use paint pigments suspended in water. This was one of the activities my class had to do during our art lessons. To create this artwork, I used a set of brushes with various sizes and a watercolor set of sixteen different colors. I painted using what was available but had to mix the colors in order to create different ones to use in my artwork.

 I used a thick piece of paper as a blank canvas to work on and a pencil to lightly draw a sketch before I commenced painting. It was a picture of a run-down wooden shack situated in the middle of a thick deserted forest and in the background were many ice-capped mountains. The painting looked very beautiful, and the scenery pictured was very serene and tranquil.

Because I enjoy painting a lot, the entire process made me feel very happy and relaxed. Of course, there was a sense of satisfaction because I was doing something I really enjoyed. At the end of the activity, I took a moment to admire the masterpiece I had created. I was very contented with it.
