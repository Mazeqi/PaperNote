Something we have had at home for a long time is my dresser where I place my clothes. My grandparents got it in the 1970s, more than three decades before I was born.

It was a gift to them from a relative in the US. They used it for a while in their room but then gave it to me when I got my own room when I was around twelve. Although the dresser doesn't really go well with the decor in my room, I still keep it as it reminds me of my grandparents. Both of them are gone now, so it's a way of remembrance.

I'm not sure if my mom thinks of them every time she sees it in my room, but I sometimes do. Aside from the memories, I find that it is quite useful. It's made of real, sturdy wood, which is why it's still very usable today. No molds grow on it as well. I'm not sure if it's because the wood is dry or because of the varnish. But it's a good thing there are no molds because I've got allergies. My friend's cabinet becomes moldy every time it rains, so I'm thankful for my dresser.
