One of the most interesting conversations I've had was two years ago at a book promotion. My favorite author is an award-winning fantasy writer, and he was promoting his most recent literary work in all major cities in the country.

At that time, I had an opportunity to have a face-to-face conversation with him. Since the genre of his books is fantasy, we talked about the sources of his inspiration and how he managed to build these magic and fantastic worlds. He gave me an insight into his creative process when he developed different characters.

Perhaps the most interesting aspect of our conversation was people's imagination. He was talking about how we need to allow the children to develop their creative side. I mentioned that I had written a few stories and that I needed courage to let other people read them. He was very understanding and he asked me to send him my stories.

At first, I was very nervous, but in the end I felt relaxed and I decided to be more self-confident and brave. The conversation about writing was so interesting that it made me feel much better and more satisfied about my future career.
