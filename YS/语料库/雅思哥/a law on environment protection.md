Here we have a law which prohibits the discarding of garbage in the river. Although this is a common-sense law and most citizens know they should not be dumping garbage in the river, there are signs and posters along the river telling people that this is illegal and prohibited by law.

This law is designed to protect our environment and to keep the rivers clean, tidy, and beautiful. Most people who throw their garbage in the river have no concern for the environment or for the other people who like to enjoy the river.

I think this a good law, as it protects our waters and it attempts to keep our waters clean for current and future generations. People who discard their garbage in our rivers are not only damaging the scenic beauty of the rivers, they are polluting the rivers so others cannot use it safely. And this pollution is killing some of the fish and other water creatures that live in or near the river.
