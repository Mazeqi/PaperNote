This happened a year ago over the holiday season before Covid-19 came. A friend of mine invited me to his birthday party, which was just before the New Year. I went to the mall to buy something for him - just a simple T-shirt with the print of a Marvel character that he likes a lot.  The problem was that many people were there, purchasing things for the New Year celebration. I excepted that only the supermarket would be packed, but the boutiques were also filled with people buying things for loved ones. I guess it was also because of the different holiday ales at the time.

Though it was supposed to be a joyful time, I felt irritated waiting in line. I realized that I should have gone much earlier in the week rather than waiting for the last minute. But since the party was in the evening, I couldn't just return on another day, so I stayed in line for about 45 minutes or so. Some shoppers had multiple baskets of things to buy, and the cashier also encountered a problem with the cash register, so there was a delay in processing payments. It's a good thing I had games on my phone to keep me busy.
