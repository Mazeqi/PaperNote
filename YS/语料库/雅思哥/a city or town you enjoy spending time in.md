My favorite part of ShangHai is Huangpu, in the center of the city. It is  very busy part of the city and is a popular destination for tourists because of the history and interesting attractions such as the Bund and the People's Square.

Many people visit HuangPu to shop as there are a huge number of lovely stores in the area, particularly along the Nanjing road(which is the world's longest shopping district). There are also a lot of excellent restaurants and other places to eat, so it's a popular place for young people to meet up.

While I enjoy the shopping culture in the area, the thing I like the most about it is the art galleries and museums. For example, the Shanghai Museum and the Shanghai Gallery of Art are both in this district. These attractions are like peaceful havens among the hustle and bustle of this highly populated area. I love the feeling of walking off a busy street and into a large, beautiful gallery where I can learn about the history of this amazing city and marvel at the talents of artists from both the past and the present.
