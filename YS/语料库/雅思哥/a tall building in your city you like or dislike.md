A tall building in my area that I like is the one which my uncle's condominium is in. It's located just a few blocks from where I live, but in a fancier neighborhood than mine.

As I mentioned, it's a condominium, so a lot of people live there. From what I've heard, there's a good mix of small families, students living together, and single people living there. On the ground floor, there's even a grocery, so the residents don't have to go far for their essentials.

The building is quite new as it was built less than 5 years ago. So it's quite modern-looking with a lot of glass windows.

I like it a lot because of the amenities. There's a fancy gym inside, which is much better than the community gym that  I share with others. They also have a beautiful infinity pool there that I like to swim in. In fact, I try to visit my uncle at least three times a month just to use the pool. There's also a recreation room filled with games like billiards, darts, and table tennis. It's a really popular place for the younger people who live there. I'v made a friend or two there as well who I play games with whenever I visit.
