I think a skill I can teach others is how to play basketball. I'm not an expert at it, so I cannot teach those who are really good. But for beginners, I can teach them the basics.

I first learned how to play hen I was in high school. My brother and cousins were into basketball, so I was intrigued by the sport. After watching it on TV with them, they taught me the basics of the sport. I think the best way to teach beginners is to first gather them around and discuss the basic rules of the game. From there, I can then show them how to dribble and shoot the ball. Since it takes time to learn, it is best to focus on the most basic skills, like dribbling and shooting, before proceeding to the more difficult things like passing and defending.

Although basketball is not an essential skill, it is a fun way to pass the time and keep fit. Professional basketball is also quite popular in my country and overseas, so it is a sport that can connect you with many people, especially if you have plans on studying or working abroad.  This is why it is quite helpful to learn it.
