A city I'd like to live in in the future is Singapore which is both a city and a country, located at the tip of Malaysia.  I'v heard about it a lot since it's one of the well-known cities in Asia and even the world. When people talk about very modern and progressive countries, Singapore if often in the top 10.

From what I've heard and read, Singapore is known for being a very orderly and disciplined city. People are not allowed to litter or break the law because Singapore's goverment strictly enforces the law. I've heard the fines are very high and CCTV cameras are everywhere, so people are very afraid to do the wrong thing.

As for why I'd like to live there, I guess it's all about the quality of life. The healthcare system is good, they have high salaries and the place is generally safe. I think it would be a great place to raise a family. And since it's relatively near China, I can still return home to visit my parents. Perhaps the biggest concern is to ensure that you have a stable job there because the cost living is high. That's why I hope to get a degree soon from a foreign university so that I can secure a good job in Singapore one day.
