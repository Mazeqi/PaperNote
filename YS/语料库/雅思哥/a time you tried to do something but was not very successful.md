A few months ago, I decided to try something I have never done before. I decided to go ice skating with another two close friends of mine. We headed to a huge  shopping mall that had an ice-skating rink inside. Because this was something I had always dreamed of doing, I felt thrilled but nervous at the same time.

Once we reached the rink, we geared up with protective knee pads, gloves, and socks before putting on the ice skates. I thought ice skating was something simple and easy, but this could not have been further from the truth. I should've asked one of my friends for some advice before I started moving my feet, but I didn't. So, the next thing was I immediately lost balance and fell to the ground. Thanks to the overconfidence, I ended up embarrassing myself in front of so many other people, especially the youngsters.

After laughing for a while, my friends kindly helped me to my feet. My face was flushed red due to the embarrassment, but before long, I laughed if off too. I felt a little pain which wore off eventually. Overall, it was still a great experience which I thoroughly enjoyed despite what had happened.
