For me, I like sunny but cool days. I love seeing the sun as it makes me happy. Even if I'm expecting something difficult, like a major exam, the sunshine in the morning makes me feel hopeful.

I often take long walks at the park on such days as I can see a lot of people enjoying the weather. People often read on the park benches, while others have a picnic when the weather is nice. It's good to see people in a good mood. Aside from walking in the park, it's also great weather to catch up with a friend over coffee or tea.

There's this one place near the school where I can sit outside for coffee and tea. When it's sunny and cool, it's also easy to bike to school and back as I don't have to worry about getting burned or wet. I guess that's why I like where I live right now because we do have a lot of cool and sunny days. Although I do enjoy visiting countries that have different kinds of weather, I find that I'm happiest in places that have weather that is similar to my place - sunny but cool.
