I remember there was one day when I was at home by myself studying when the power went out. It was nighttime, so the room was pitch-dark and I couldn't see a thing. I wanted to go out to check and see if there was something wrong with the circuit, but I was unsure how to leave the room.

I didn't have a flashlight with me and I was worried I might trip on something and fall. Then, I closed my eyes and used my imagination to visualize what the room looked like, so I could figure out how to get out without tripping or breaking something.

It wasn't easy at all, because I was quite anxious, but I stayed focused and tried focused and tried to picture everything that was in the room, and I was able to leave the room successfully. I didn't break anything or fall on something, and I managed to walk across the hall and check what was wrong in the circuit and I switched the electricity back on.

Overall, I felt proud that I was able to rely on imagination to fix an uncomfortable situation.
