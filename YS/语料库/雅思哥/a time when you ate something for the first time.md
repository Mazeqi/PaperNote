The first time I ate rock lobster was a wonderful experience.

I had it for the first time only a few weeks ago at a dinner party with some friends. We all met up at my best friend's house and brought different foods along to share. One of my friends was lucky enough to procure some lobsters from his uncle. They are often very expensive but he got them for free! We went outside and lit a fire to roast the lobsters on an open flame. We seasoned them with just a litter bit of salt, pepper and lemon because we didn't want to interfere too much with the smokey flavor from the fire. I brought along a big, tomato pasta dish to dinner party, and when the lobster was ready, we decided to add it to the pasta.

I felt like it was such a unique and special experience, and the lobster was delicious when mixed into the pasta. There was something so fun about cooking on a fire and then pulling the hot lobsters apart with our hands. It felt so primal and exciting, and we laughed and talked together throughout the process.
