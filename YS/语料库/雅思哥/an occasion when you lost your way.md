When I was a small child I got lost inside a department store.

I was with my mother, but I wandered off and couldn't find her again. I remember holding her hand as we browsed through dresses in a women's clothing shop. She stopped to ask one of the employees about sizing. At the same time I noticed that there was a toy shop nearby. Without really thinking about it, I walked over to look at some colorful building blocks which were displayed in the window. When I returned to the clothing store, my mother was nowhere to be seen!

I suddenly felt very scared and alone, but instead of asking one of the employees if they knew where my mother was, I started trying to look for her myself. I walked in and out of a few shops, but I really had no idea where she could have gone.

I was starting to think that I might be lost forever when I heard a voice over the department store's speaker system which was talking about a lost child. It turned out that my mother had approached an employee and asked them to call for me. I went to the Information Desk and was reunited with her.
