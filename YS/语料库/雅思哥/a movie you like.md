I first watched The Lion King as a young child, and then watched it again several times over the years.

This animated film is about a lion prince named Simba, whose uncle kills Simba's father and makes himself the ruler. But Simba is held responsible for the death of his father, so he runs away out of guilty.

Many years later, Simba is told that the kingdom is in serious trouble. So he faces up to the challenge and returns. With the help of his friends, he defeats his uncle and saves the kingdom.

I enjoyed watching this film because most of the characters were very cute, and the soundtrack to the film was amazing. I particularly enjoyed the theme song '"Can  You Feel the Love Tonight." by Elton John.

The film also taught me valuable life lessons. For example, it taught me that running away wouldn't solve any problems. It also taught me the importance of courage and friendship.
