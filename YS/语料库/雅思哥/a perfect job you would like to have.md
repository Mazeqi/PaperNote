In the future, I would like to become a career counselor for university students. I didn't know that this job existed until very recently, when I went to visit one myself. While I am already studying certain subjects at university, I'm still not completely sure which career path I'd like to follow once I graduate. I explained this to one of my lecturers, who suggested that I visit the campus career counselor.

A career counselor's role is to guide students in choosing the correct jobs. They understand how people's interests as well as their strengths and weaknesses can influence their efficacy in different careers, and they can advise those people in terms of how they might achieve their goals. They also have a broad understanding of kinds of jobs that exist in this day and age, which average people may not be aware of.

I believe that this would be the perfect job for me because I love helping people through open and honest discussions. I think it would be really interesting to learn about the kinds of jobs that exist, and the various pathways that people can follow towards a career.
