I believe it was last week when I spoke to my good friend, Mary, that I am going to immigrate to Canada. The reason why I have found it hard to tell her is because I am her best friend since we met each other. We are both in our second year of high school, and I was concerned that this news might disrupt her studies. So I had never mentioned this plan before and just pretended that I would participate in the college entrance exam just like her. Now that the day of my family moving to Vancouver is coming close, I could not hide it any longer.

So I told her that I wanted to discuss something important with her and we met in the cafe near her house. She was surprised to see me looking so serious at first and after I told her the truth, she turned out to be happy for me. She even promised that she would visit me after graduation. This conversation actually made me become more aware of what friendship really meant. It seemed that I had undervalued our relationship as I was constantly afraid that the departure would mean the end of our friendship.
