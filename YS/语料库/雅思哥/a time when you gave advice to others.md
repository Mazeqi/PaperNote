Recently my roommate had been acting a bit strange for a few days, and because she is a good friend of mine, I asked her what was wrong. She told me that he boyfriend had been making excuses not to see her, and not replying to her texts or answering her phone. She was very worried.

I told her that she could express to him that she loves him, and ask him if she has upset him in some way. Then she should give him space and not harass him, because if he really loves her, he will get over the problem.

I felt that I could give this advice because I have experienced this in a similar situation before. Last year, my boyfriend seemed upset with me for a while and I didn't know why, nut I just left him alone for  few days and he was eventually back to his usual self - the problem just blew over.

It made me feel good about myself to be able to give relationship advice to someone else. I felt confident that things would work out for the best. My friend was very thankful for my advice, which was gratifying.
