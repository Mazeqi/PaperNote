I'm going to talk about jigsaw puzzle. It consist of many pieces that have unique shapes. When you place the pieces at the right places, they fit snugly. Eventually, all of them in their correct locations will form the final big picture. I usually choose jigsaw puzzles that paint breath-taking sceneries or quirky cartoon characters.

The difficulty of the puzzle depends on several factors. The number and shape of pieces and the overall color scheme determine the difficulty. A challenging one will have a few thousand pieces or very similar colors that cover most of the picture.

Usually, I spend five to ten hours completing a thousand-piece puzzle and the longest time I have taken to complete one puzzle is roughly twenty hours. The duration varies a lot depending on how tough it is.

Putting together a jigsaw puzzle feels like a roller-coaster of emotions to me. When I face an obstacle in fitting the pieces together, I tend to feel frustrated and exasperated. I normally must convince myself to complete it. When I successfully finish it though, I always feel an overwhelming sense of accomplishment and satisfaction. The harder the puzzle is, the greater this sense of achievement. Overall, this is a hobby I am happy to invest my time in.
