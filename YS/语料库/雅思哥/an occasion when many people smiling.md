The last time I recall seeing a lot of people smiling was in November of 2019, before the pandemic.

At the time, I was with my family members and some family friends. We were in the function room of local hotel. The event was my little cousin Alia's first birthday, and we were celebrating it together. Although my uncle is a very thrifty person, since Alia was my grandparents' first granddaughter, the family wanted a big celebration. I think that even my dad chipped in  for the expenses.

Among the cousins, we are currently all boys of varying ages, so Alia is the very girl among us, making her one of a kind. My other uncles and aunts were also quite happy about the fact, so everybody was smiling in a festive mood. It was also the first time in a long time that the clan was all together. Two of my aunts work abroad but they flew home just to attend. So it was really a special  day - a birthday and family reunion all rolled into one. We took a lot of pictures that day and printed one out the day after. Now the photo's displayed in our living room.
