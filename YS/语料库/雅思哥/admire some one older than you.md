​	**I honestly believe that we can learn a lot from older people and that they are truly worthy of our respect and admiration.** The elderly person I hold in considerable respect is my high-school English teacher Mr.Gao, who is about to retire next year.

​	Mr.Gao has spent his entire teaching career in my high school. I can say, without any doubt, that I consider myself incredibly lucky to have been his student for 2 years. He is an excellent teacher with an exemplary character. 

​	I really believe that all his students can agree that Mr.Gao is a prudent, a strong-willed man with impeccable moral character. His sense of judgment and fairness could never be questioned. If you are feeling blue, his lesson will make your day because they are full of humor. 

​	I greatly respect him because his teaching did not only include English, but also valuable life lessons whose importance I came to realize after I finished high school. My respect for him derives from the fact that his personality and teaching skills have taught me to work hard and to be a reliable critic of my own work. I have always thought of him as teacher of great personal integrity because his magnetic personality inspired everyone around him.
