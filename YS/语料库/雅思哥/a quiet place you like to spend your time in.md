Whenever I want some peace, I go to the nature park which is just a short distance from my apartment.

I found the nature park when I was taking my daily walk. I took a different walking route that I normally took and I was surprised and delighted to find this well-kept secret.

Now I go there a couple of times a week. When I visit, I am usually the only person there. It is rare when other people are there at the same time.

The nature park is set in the middle of a small forest which is intersected by a creek with a waterfall. It also has some rock cliffs which add to the beauty of the place. I have seen lots of birds and small animals frolicking in the nature park. That includes ducks, geese, chipmunks, squirrels, and rabbits. Every time I go, I'd bring my camera along. I just can't help photographing the interesting interactions between different creatures in this secretive place.

I am really glad found the nature park. It is hard to believe that there can be so much natural beauty within an urban setting.
