​	My aunt's home is in the middle of a huge, bustling city. While it is a very beautiful house, I personally would not like to live in it.

​	It is a large and extremely modern home, with lots of technology built into it. There are no light switches on the walls. Instead, all of the electronics are controlled through an app that you can download onto your phone, which is the part that I like the most as I can just lay on the sofa and turn on all the electronics with my fingertip.

​	The interior of the house also has very uniform color scheme of white and grey; all of the walls are white while the artwork, carpets and bench tops are all grey. We often visit my aunt's home because it is big enough to accommodate most of our family so I love the warm atmosphere there. 

​	While I can see that it may be a dream house in the eyes of others, I don't like to live there. The interior design is a bit bland for my taste. I like things to be full of color and life, and I found the color scheme in this home to be a bit boring. The technology in the home is very interesting, but I think it over complicates things rather than making them easier.
