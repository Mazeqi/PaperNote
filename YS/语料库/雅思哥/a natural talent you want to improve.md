I'd like to improve my drawing ability. Although I can make some doodles, I don't think they're good enough for a job or even to impress anyone.

I think I first began doodling when I was in elementary school. I was inspired by various cartoon characters and even stories I heard from my grandparents. So I began to draw faces of different characters and creatures back then.

Now, if I have the time and money, I'd like to have formal lessons with someone who knows what they're doing.  I've heard there are online tutorials, but I'm the type of person who needs a teacher to push me. As for my feelings, well it's something I think about but it's currently not a priority.

I'm more concerned now about getting into a university overseas than practicing my drawing skills. So I'm focused on my language review and other things. But like I said, if an opportunity presents itself, I'd love to learn how to draw better. I think such a skill can be useful, especially if I have kids in the future. I might be able to draw their favorite cartoon characters or animal for them upon request. That would be fun.
