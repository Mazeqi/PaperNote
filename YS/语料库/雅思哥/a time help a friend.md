​	The last time I helped a friend was just recently. I believe it was two weeks ago. I bumped into my friend at the grocery. We were both buying household supplies for our families since we are both the eldest sibling in the family. My friend was ahead of me in the line paying when he suddenly turned to me because he lacked some money. He asked if I could lend him some money to buy the noodles that his little sister wanted. If not, he'd have to put it back on the shelf. Since it wasn't  that costly, I told him it was a gift from me.

​	I've met his family many times before, and I know his little sister who's a six-year-old noodle lover. I could imagine how disappointed she would be if my friend went home without the noodles, so I decided to help him.

​	When I was heading back home, I was a bit worried my mom would ask about how much I spent and blamed me for the decision. Fortunately, my mom was very supporting and told me that it was a good deed. Then I felt relieved and content with myself.
