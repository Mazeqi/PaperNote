A leisure activity I would love to try is surfing. Surfing involves a surfboard. The individual stands and balances on the surfboard while riding on a moving wave of water, and this propels him towards the shore.

To prepare for this, I would need to buy the right gear and equipment. I need a wetsuit and a surfboard because I currently do not have either of these items. I would also require sunscreen to avoid getting sunburnt. Some coaching advice from a professional surfer would also help me tremendously because I have no knowledge or experience surfing at all.

Even with advice and lessons from professional, I believe that learning to surf is a very challenging and daunting task. I think that it involves a lot of skill and balance and I would probably fail many times before succeeding,

Despite this, I am eager to learn and try surfing. It seems like a very rewarding and exhilarating experience because I am doing something I have never done before. When I get the hang of it, there would definitely be a huge sense of satisfaction and achievement. Plus, I get to enjoy the winds, waves, and beauty of nature.
