After school, I usually go for swimming lessons.

My swimming lesson sessions are normally an hour to two hours long, depending on which day of the week it falls on. On Tuesdays and Thursdays, I have one-hour sessions with my personal coach and trainer, while on Saturdays, my lesson is two hours long. After school , I usually rush home to pack my swimsuit, goggles, towel and clothes before heading off to my local indoor swimming pool.

To make my lessons even more enjoyable, my best friend and I have decided to synchronize our timings so that we can do each lesson together, He is an extremely skilled and talented swimmer so he can also provide me some useful tips on how to improve my technique and skills. Often times, he is also there to give me moral support and encouragement by cheering me on whenever I feel too tired to continue training,

Even though the lessons can be extremely taxing and exhausting at times, I still look forward to each session and feel a rush of adrenaline and thrill whenever I step into the pool. After each swimming session, I go home feeling refreshed and energized and have a humongous appetite for good food.
