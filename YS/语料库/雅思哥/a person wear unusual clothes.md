​	Someone I personally know who wears unusual clothing is my uncle. He's the older brother of my mom. I've known my uncle ever since I was a kid.

​	The reason why I think he dresses strangely is that most of his clothes are quite old-fashioned, and they often do not match. Around the house, he wears the same white shirt and blue shorts, like every time! I thought before that he just wore his clothes for an entire week, but it turns out that he has several pairs of the same type of clothing.

​	But what makes him really strange is that his very simple attire is something he might also wear outside the house. It might be okay if he lived in the countryside. But he lives in a city where people are more fashion conscious. I'm not really sure why he's like that. I've always assumed that's how older people dress up. 

​	But then I saw the uncles and aunts of my friends and realized my uncle was weird. Maybe he's like that because he doesn't want to think about what to wear, or maybe he's saving his money for something else. Regardless, I'm just glad he's my uncle and not my dad.
