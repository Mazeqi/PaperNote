1. I agree with it.  Because recognizing the information from the  website  requires full knowledge, which is  lacked by Children. The Children are good at remembering information because they like to copy what they see and hear.  In my opinion, without restriction, Children may learn from bad information and imitate.

2. Yes,  Internet violence  is a stern problem not only faced by  Children but also adults. But don't like the adults, Children have not ability to solve the problem. So it is necessary to protect children from cyber bullying, which may hurt their heart.

3. I don't think so. Definitely, when they become adults, there will not be someone to guide them. They should think everything independently, which needs to begin at Childhood. So in my opinion, parents can guide them but not supervise them. The Children should supervise themselves.

4. Yes, I think so. At present, we have not  technique to withdraw the bad information submited by Criminals. And the bad information really pollutes the network circumstance. But we can only make some restriction on the criminals. 

5. Yes,
