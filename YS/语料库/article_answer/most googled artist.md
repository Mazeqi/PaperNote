	With art galleries and museums closed, people around the world have been forced to use the internet to look at works of art, and the UK's Ken Bromley Art Supplies has used Google Keyword Planner to find the most-searched artist in every country across 2020.

​	The company made a map of the world that shows the most Googled artist in each country, and also maps of each continent for a closer look at the results.

​	The data showed that Leonardo da Vinci was the world's most popular artist, ranked first in 82 countries — almost three times as many countries as any other artist.

​	Mexican painter Frida Kahlo was the runner-up, being ranked most popular in 29 countries, including the US, Mexico and Spain.

​	Kahlo was one of only two women on the list of top artists, with the other being Italian painter Artemisia Gentileschi.
