​	I often read books  in my leisure time. Because I can not only accumulate knowledge from a good book, but also to be calm with some matters in my life. As we all know, Books are the stepping stones to human progress.  The book I read in these days is <<*[to](javascript:;) [kill](javascript:;) [a](javascript:;) [mockingbird](javascript:;)*>> , which can teach us how to guide children more correct.

​	You know, when i was  a child, I really didn't like the homework, because I have a playful heart. So when I had free time, I was really happy. I lived in countryside in my childhood. So I can not only fly a kite with my friend on the field, but also *[bake](javascript:;) [a](javascript:;) [sweet](javascript:;) [potato](javascript:;)* which is from nature world if we were hungry. I think I have a really beatiful childhood.

​	In my nowadays life, I prefer to spend my free time alone, which is  due to I want to learn more knowledge in my free time. I don't like to be disturbed while studying. It may break my thought. However,  I also play with my friends or family in festivals, because they are important for me.

​	 In china, chinese women often have square dancing in their leisure time, which can bring happiness and health to them. It is happy for us to see  that the little children follow to learn dancing. The *[national](javascript:;) [fitness](javascript:;)* is  a grand purpose of china. And the chinese men often play chess in their free time. The chinese chess has long history, which came from *[Han](javascript:;) [Dynasty](javascript:;)* of china.

​	 I don't think so. Beacuse china is still a developing country, and it keep on a high speed development. So the people may face work overtime in weekends. As is known to us,  the 996 work time is common to *[internet](javascript:;) [company](javascript:;)*  of china. But I think it will be improved, because china is becoming better and better in every area.
