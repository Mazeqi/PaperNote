# Agree or Disagree Are Humans Inherently Good or evil?

- Humans can understand the concepts of good and evil from an early age?

   I think everyone like a blank paper when they were baby. And how to differentiate whether something is good or evil is taught by their teacher or parents. In conclusion, my opinion is that how to distinguish something is good or evil is due to the environment that people stay in.

- All people have some inherent goodness

  yes I think may be sometimes our world is not very good, but there are lots of people with virtue surround us. In china, At the beginning of 2020 year, the covid-19 were spread in wuhan, and there were lots of people including doctors, nurses, policeman went to wuhan without thinking the saveness of themselves. Finally , they save wuhan, they are most beautiful in china

- People are either completely evil or completely good.

  no, I don't think so. I think everyone is selfness, because everyone need to live for themselves. But the person who can help other people in their need, they can be called selfless.  And I think that if someone can stay in a good environment, there are more possibilities for him to be good. 

- Some one are born evil.
- A person's behavior is greatly influenced by their environment.
