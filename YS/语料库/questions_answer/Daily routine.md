# One three one

​	I  divide my time to get up into two kinds, which due to  if there is the lesson in the morning.

The first, I get up at 7.00 o'clock if there is a lesson at half past eight. Secondly, I get up at 8 o'clock to have more rest time if  i am free in the morning. However, I always listen to BBC after getting up in the morning because I want to improve my listening ability.

​	Usually, I have the same routine, because  I always have class in the morning of weekdays. However, I usually have free time in the afternoon and in the evening , and I always spend my free time in the library. Because I am doing research on computer vision. I read many papers from the  Top Journal, such as cvpr, AAAI and so on. I return to the dormitory at 10 o'clock because the library close the door. I usually have the 30 minutes to read books before sleeping, which helps me to be calm.

​	Because there are a lot of festivals in china, Such as Dragon boat festival, Mid-autumn Festival, Spring festival.  And I usually stay with my friend or family at the festival. The festival I am favourite in is mid-autumn festival, because it is a symbol of reunion. Not matter where people there are at, they all return to home and admire the full moon together. The moon cake is a symbol of mid-autumn festival, it is really tasty.

​	The time to get up is similar to when i was a child. Because my parents also get up early, they teach me *[the](javascript:;) [early](javascript:;) [bird](javascript:;) [catches](javascript:;) [the](javascript:;) [worm](javascript:;)* . Differently, I don't like studying and reading books at my childhood.  You know, every child has a playful heart, and i always spent time with my friends to  play games.

​	I think it's important, because it can let you know what you have done in one day.
