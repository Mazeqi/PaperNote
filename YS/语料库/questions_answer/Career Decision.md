# Are High School Seniors Too Immature to Make Career Decisions?

- High School seniors don't take their future lightly?

  I think someone can communicate with their teacher or parents, and then make a decision

  don't take their future carefully. You know, the elderly people is the teacher, the spiritual guide of young people because of their experience.

- They are susceptible to the influence of their peers and teachers

  It is common, because they spend most of their time in the school. But I think the teacher should guide High school seniors to think independent, and then generalize all the advice to make a better decision.

- The fact that they care about their future proves that they are mature enough.

  no, I think a person to be mature can stand in other people's position to think about something. Because it will lead young people to do things more carefully. Otherwise, to be careful about their future can let young people to be more hardworking.

- High School Seniors are not mature and old enough to decide on their career.

  no,  I think there is not a fully accurate decision. It is a test. But the decision made by elderly people may be more reasonable because they have more knowledge and more experience. But i think every person should make decision independently because I think they can pay more attention on the decision that was made by themselves.

- Even if they think carefully, they still might make the wrong decision.
