# Agree or Disagree are School Rules Necessary?

- Rules are an important part of a child's learning.

  **Rules prepare your children for the real world**  Having clear expectations, such as “no hitting each other” or ” all your toys need to be picked up before bedtime & tidied away,” to “ we all brush our teeth after breakfast” and then enforcing consequences if they break the rules, will help them adapt better to new situations, perform better at school and fit in easily at work & in society generally.

- Strict rules hinder creativity.

   Yes,  The purpose of rules is to guide children but not to control children. The strict rules will reduce the curiosity of this world. They will consider if they will get the punishment after they do one thing. So the rules are needed but not the strict rules.

- School rules protect students and teachers

  Yes, Some rules are just basic manners, like saying “please” & “thank you” or “excuse me” before interrupting. If you make it a policy to use polite words at school, your child will not only be more pleasant to be around, but they’ll also learn appropriate ways to get what they want & need. Respect is the key energy of any happy school.

- Children should learn to accept responsibility

  Yes, 

- Rules do not need to be strict to be effective.
