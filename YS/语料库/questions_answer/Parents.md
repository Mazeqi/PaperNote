# Parents are leaders and role models

- Parents are leaders and role models

  Children are good at learning what they see and hear. And at the beginning of their life, they learn almost all things from their parents. During the children time, it is easy to form some good habits that will be useful in children's future, such as reading books, finishing a hard task. So in order to let children have more abilities to face to the problems in their life, parents should be leaders and role models.

- Children should learn how to be responsible from a young age.

  Yes, no one will not make mistakes, expecially the children.  However, to be responsible for the mistakes is most important in my eyes.  learning to be responsible have quite lots of advantages, It will make children more caring and understanding, It will  make children more independent. Most importantly, it will lead children to make less mistakes in their future. 

- Parents should be held responsible for their children's actions

  yes, Parents are the first teachers to the children.  The parents should teach children what they can do and teach them how to differentiate something is good or not good.  And the parents are guardians in law to the children. Parents is required to guide their children.

- Minors lack the ability to fully understand responsibility

  I don't think so.  To be responsible for the mistakes is the symbol to understand the responsibility. People who escape from the punishment that brings from the mistake is not a responsible people.  In my opinion, if the minors face to the mistakes they made, and apologize for their problems can understand the responsibility.  

- Parents cannot always influence their children's decisions or actions.
