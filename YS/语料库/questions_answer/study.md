​	I am currently studying computer vision which is a very popular major at *[Guangdong](javascript:;) [University](javascript:;) [of](javascript:;) [Technology](javascript:;)* . My university is famous in Guangdong because of it's engineering subject, which is popular in students. 

​	For the two reasons, I choose the computer vision subject. First, as you know, the Artificial intelligence  becomes more and more important in our daily life and computer vision is a decisive part in it.  Secondly, to solve the problems of industry and make our daily life more easily  by using my own knowledge is one of  my wishes.

In China, if you send a rose to others, its fragrance will remain in your hands.  Occasionly,  we have argument in the work, but we all forget it after we finish the work.
