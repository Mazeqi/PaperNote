# Non-local Neural Networks



## Introduction

- Convolution and recurrent operations both process a local neighborhood,ether in space or time; thus long-range dependencies can only be captured when these operations are applied repeatedly

### Several advantages of using non-local operations

- (a) capture long-range dependencies directly by computing interactions between any two positions, regardless of their positional distance
- (b) non-local operations are efficient and achieve their best results even with only a few layers
- (c) maintain the variable input sizes and can be easily combined with other operations
