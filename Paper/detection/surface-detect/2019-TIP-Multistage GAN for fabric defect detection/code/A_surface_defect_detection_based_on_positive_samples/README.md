# A_surface_defect_detection_based_on_positive_samples
 Generate randomly defects on positive samples and  restore them with GAN. 
 
 ## Note:
 
 1. It is built from the [Pix2Pix](https://github.com/junyanz/pytorch-CycleGAN-and-pix2pix) respository.
 
 2. There are three different models, consisting of  autoencoder, segment model(Unet), and GAN (Pix2Pix).
 
 3. It is inspire by the paper "A Surface Defect Detection Method Based on Positive Samples".
 
 4. We Got the 5th place in the preliminary contest of [National campus machine vison application competition](https://www.marsbigdata.com/competition/details?id=5293671830016).
